    The two means split finds the cutpoint that minimizes the one-dimensional
    2-means objective, which is finding the cutoff point where the total variance
    from cluster 1 and cluster 2 are minimal.

    The mathematical optimization problem is to find the cutoff index ``s``,
    which is called 'pos' in scikit-learn.

        \min_s \sum_{i=1}^s (x_i - \hat{\mu}_1)^2 + \sum_{i=s+1}^N (x_i - \hat{\mu}_2)^2

    where x is a N-dimensional feature vector, N is the number of sample_indices and
    the \mu terms are the estimated means of each cluster 1 and 2.

    The variance of the node, left child and right child is computed by keeping track of
    `sum_total`, `sum_left` and `sum_right`, which are the sums of a feature vector at
    varying split points.

    Weighted Mean and Variance
    --------------------------
    Since we allow `sample_weights` to be passed, then we optionally allow for us
    to compute a weighted sample mean and weighted sample variance. The weighted
    sample variance has two approaches to compute an unbiased estimate. The first
    is using "frequencies" and the second is using "reliability" weights. Currently,
    we have impmlemented the frequencies approach.

    # TODO: implement reliability weighting

    Node-Wise Feature Generation
    ----------------------------
    URerF doesn't choose split points in the original feature space
    It follows the random projection framework

    \tilde{X}= A^T X'

    where, A is p x d matrix distributed as f_A, where f_A is the
    projection distribution and d is the dimensionality of the
    projected space. A is generated by randomly sampling from
    {-1,+1} lpd times, then distributing these values uniformly
    at random in A. l parameter is used to control the sparsity of A
    and is set to 1/20.

    Each of the d rows \tilde{X}[i; :], i \in {1,2,...d} is then
    inspected for the best split point. The optimal split point and
    splitting dimension are chosen according to which point/dimension
    pair minimizes the splitting criteria described in the following

    The Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) is a popular model seleciton 
    criteria that is based on the log likelihood of the model given data.
    MClust-BIC is a method in the R-package 'mclust' that uses BIC as a splitting
    criterion.
    See: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/237220/mclust-model-selection

    Fast-BIC is a method that combines the speed of the two-means clustering 
    method with the model flexibility of Mclust-BIC. It sorts data for each 
    feature and tries all possible splits to assign data points to one of 
    two Gaussian distributions based on their position relative to the split.
    The parameters for each cluster are estimated using maximum likelihood 
    estimation (MLE). The method performs hard clustering rather than soft 
    clustering like in GMM, resulting in a simpler calculation of the likelihood.
    
    \hat{L} = \sum_{n=1}^s[\log\hat{\pi}_1+\log{\mathcal{N}(x_n;\hat{\mu}_1,\hat{\sigma}_1^2)}]
    + \sum_{n=s+1}^N[\log\hat{\pi}_2+\log{\mathcal{N}(x_n;\hat{\mu}_2,\hat{\sigma}_2^2)}]
    
    where the prior, mean, and variance are defined as follows, respectively:
    
    - \hat{\pi} = \frac{s}{N}
    - \hat{\mu} = \frac{1}{s}\sum_{n\le s}{x_n},
    - \hat{\sigma}^2 = \frac{1}{s}\sum_{n\le s}{||x_n-\hat{\mu_j}||^2}

    Fast-BIC is guaranteed to obtain the global maximum likelihood estimator.
    Additionally, Fast-BIC is substantially faster than the traditional BIC method.
